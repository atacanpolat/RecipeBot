# SEBA Master SS23 - Team 31
Project Setup and Execution:

First of all you need to download source code of the web application.

# Opening the Project in Visual Studio Code
To initiate the development process, access Visual Studio Code. Open the project by navigating to the project folder and selecting it from the IDE's file explorer.

# BACKEND
## Setting up Backend Dependencies
Once the project is open, proceed to the terminal within Visual Studio Code. Change the directory to the "â€¦/prototype/backend" folder, which stores the backend components of our web application.

## Installing Backend Dependencies
In the terminal, execute the command `npm install` to automatically install all the required dependencies for the backend. Ensure that the process completes successfully before proceeding to the next step.

##  Starting the Backend Server
With the dependencies installed, start the backend server by running the command `npm start` in the terminal. The server will be launched and configured to listen on port 8000.

# FRONTEND
## Launching the Frontend
To activate the frontend of the web application, change the directory to the frontend folder.

## Installing Frontend Dependencies
In the terminal, execute the command `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` to install all the frontend dependencies.<br><br>
**IMPORTANT**: Due to some conflicts in the dependencies we need to run npm install with the --legacy-peer-deps Wait for the installation to finish before proceeding further.

## Starting the Frontend Application:
Finally, initiate the frontend application by entering the command `npm start` in the terminal. The web application will be launched and automatically opened in a new browser window.
<br>
By following these steps diligently, the web application will be up and running, with both the backend and frontend components seamlessly integrated. This setup allows for efficient development and testing, ensuring a smooth and successful project execution.
